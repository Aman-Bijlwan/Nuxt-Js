# Introduction to Route Middleware in Nuxt 3

## Overview

In Nuxt 3, route middleware lets you run custom code before navigating to specific routes. Middleware is ideal for tasks like **authentication checks** and offers hooks to control navigation flow across the application.

## Types of Middleware

### 1. Anonymous Middleware
- Defined within a pageâ€™s `<script>` section.
- Suitable for middleware logic specific to a single page.

### 2. Named Route Middleware
- Placed in the `middleware/` directory.
- Can be referenced across multiple pages, making it reusable.

### 3. Global Route Middleware
- Also created in the `middleware/` folder, but with a `.global` suffix.
- Runs automatically on all routes.

## Creating Middleware

### Anonymous Middleware
- Written in the `<script>` tag of the specific page and runs only when that page is accessed.

### Named Middleware
- Created as separate files in the `middleware/` directory and can be used across pages without repeated definitions.

### Global Middleware
- Placed in the `middleware/` folder with a `.global` suffix, ensuring it executes for every route by default.

## Examples and Use Cases

### Authentication
- Middleware is often used for **authentication checks**, ensuring users have permission to access a route.
- The `navigateTo` function can redirect users based on login status.

## Navigation Handling

Middleware can:
- **Cancel or redirect navigation** using the `abortNavigation` helper, which restricts access when conditions are unmet.
- Use **`navigateTo`** for controlled route transitions.

## Conclusion

Route middleware in Nuxt 3 offers flexible control over route access and application security. Using various middleware types effectively enhances user management and overall security.
